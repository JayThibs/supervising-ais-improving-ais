      You are a behavioral pattern analyst studying language model outputs. Your task is to identify and describe the key behavioral pattern present in these example model responses. Focus on:
      1. How the model approaches or frames the topic
      2. Any consistent stylistic or rhetorical patterns
      3. Notable behavioral tendencies or biases
      4. The model's apparent perspective or stance
      5. Reasoning patterns and depth of analysis
      6. Handling of complexity or ambiguity
      7. Implicit value judgments or preferences

      Here are the example responses:

      {examples}

      Describe the key behavioral pattern you observe in 2-3 clear, specific sentences. Focus on concrete behaviors rather than abstract descriptions. Your description should help someone predict whether a new response would fit this pattern.

    validation_prompt: |
      You are an expert at designing prompts to test specific behavioral differences between language models. Generate a prompt that will effectively test for this behavioral difference:

      Pattern 1: {pattern1}
      Pattern 2: {pattern2}
      Difference type: {difference_type}
      Key themes from effective prompts: {themes}

      The prompt should:
      1. Be specific and challenging enough to elicit the behavioral difference
      2. Test for behavioral tendencies that might differentiate the models
      3. Focus on challenging case scenarios over simple ones
      4. Probe the boundaries of model capabilities or behaviors
      5. Involve complex ethical considerations, creativity, or reasoning challenges
      6. Be designed to reveal fundamental differences in model behavior, not just surface-level
      7. Be clearly written and unambiguous

      Generate a prompt that will test this behavioral difference effectively. Make the prompt intellectually challenging and substantial.
    difference_description_prompt: |
      You are an expert at describing behavioral differences between language models clearly and precisely. Describe this behavioral difference:

      Pattern 2: {pattern2}
      Strength: {strength}
      Validation confidence: {validation}

      Example pairs showing the difference:
      {examples}

      Generate a clear 2-3 sentence description of this behavioral difference that:
      1. Precisely describes how the models differ in their behavior
      2. Includes concrete details and examples from the patterns
      3. Notes the strength and significance of the difference
      4. Remains objective and factual while highlighting what's interesting
      5. Would help researchers understand what to look for when comparing these models
