# Detailed Analysis of the Soft Prompting Module

## Overview

The soft_prompting module implements a novel approach for discovering behavioral differences between language models using trainable soft prompts. This method leverages gradient-based optimization to find continuous prompt embeddings that maximize the divergence between two models' outputs.

## Core Approach: KL Divergence Maximization

### Key Concept
The module trains a small set of continuous embeddings (soft prompts) that are prepended to input sequences. These embeddings are optimized to maximize the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the output distributions of two models.

### Mathematical Foundation
- **Objective**: Maximize KL(P₁||P₂) where P₁ and P₂ are the output distributions from models 1 and 2
- **Implementation**: The loss function is the negative KL divergence, which is minimized during training
- **Soft Prompts**: Trainable embeddings of shape (num_tokens, embedding_dim)

### Training Process
1. Initialize random soft prompt embeddings
2. Prepend soft prompts to input embeddings
3. Forward pass through both frozen models
4. Compute KL divergence between output distributions
5. Backpropagate gradients only through soft prompt parameters
6. Update soft prompts to maximize divergence
