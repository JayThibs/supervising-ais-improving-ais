Hypothesis Generator Module

This module converts circuit patterns and feature interpretations into testable
behavioral hypotheses. It bridges the gap between mechanistic findings and
observable behaviors.

Key Algorithm:
    1. Take identified patterns from circuit analysis
    2. Use feature interpretations to understand what changed
    3. Generate concrete predictions about behavioral differences
    4. Provide test generation strategies for validation

Example:
    If we find that features related to "refusal" are suppressed in layer 10,
    we hypothesize that the model will be more likely to comply with 
    potentially harmful requests.
